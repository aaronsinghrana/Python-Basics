# 🐍 Python Programming Project (Data Technician Bootcamp)

This repository contains a Python project completed during a **Data Technician bootcamp**, designed to build strong foundations in programming logic and user interaction. The work focuses on writing clear Python code to solve problems, perform calculations and interact with users through the terminal 💻

The project demonstrates how core Python concepts come together to create logical and reusable solutions, similar to what would be expected in real technical tasks and entry-level data roles.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated

* Using variables to store and update data
* Displaying output with the `print()` function
* Capturing user input with the `input()` function
* Applying type casting to convert user input into usable data types
* Building decision logic with `if`, `elif` and `else` statements
* Repeating logic using `for` loops and `while` loops

These skills were combined to build structured logic, control program flow and create interactive scripts that respond dynamically to different inputs ✨

This screenshot shows the classic **FizzBuzz** challenge implemented in Python using a `for` loop and `if` statements. The code loops through numbers from 1 to 100 and applies conditional logic to print `"fizz"`, `"buzz"` or `"fizzbuzz"` when specific conditions are met. This task highlights logical thinking, loop control and clean conditional structure 🔁

## 📈 Project Outcomes

By completing this project, I strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals and how individual concepts work together in practice. The exercises helped reinforce problem-solving skills, logical thinking and confidence in writing readable code.

This project demonstrates my ability to use Python to build logic-driven solutions, perform calculations and interact with users, forming a solid foundation for further learning in data analysis and automation 🚀
